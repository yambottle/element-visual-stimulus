# Element Visual Stimulus

DataJoint Element for visual stimulus presentation with Psychtoolbox. DataJoint Elements
collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience
experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with
corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a
fully functional pipeline.

Element Visual Stimulus runs Psychtoolbox to procedurally generate visual stimuli as
well as provide synchronization information to a diode positioned in the corner of the
screen.

Visit the [Concepts page](./concepts.md) for more information on stimulus presentation.
To get started with building your data pipeline visit the
